# Tobacco-Mortality-Analysis
# üìò Introduction
Tobacco consumption remains one of the leading preventable causes of mortality worldwide, contributing to numerous chronic diseases and premature deaths. However, comprehensive analysis of tobacco-related mortality patterns requires sophisticated data analytics to uncover hidden trends, risk factors, and demographic disparities. This project introduces an advanced analytical framework for examining the complex relationship between tobacco usage and mortality rates across different populations and regions.

Unlike conventional statistical approaches, this system employs multidimensional data analysis, geospatial mapping, and predictive modeling techniques. These methods are particularly effective at identifying subtle patterns, regional variations, and predictive factors in tobacco-related mortality, making them crucial for public health interventions and policy planning.

# üéØ Objectives
Analyze tobacco-related mortality patterns based on comprehensive datasets: Demographic information, consumption habits, health indicators, geographical data, and temporal trends.

Develop predictive models to estimate mortality risks and identify high-risk population segments using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Generate actionable insights through sophisticated data visualization and interactive dashboards for public health stakeholders.

Evaluate model performance using both classification and regression metrics:

‚úÖ Accuracy and Precision
‚úÖ Recall and F1-Score
‚úÖ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
‚úÖ R-squared Score
‚úÖ Geospatial Analysis Accuracy

This system aims to equip healthcare policymakers, researchers, and public health organizations with data-driven insights to design targeted anti-tobacco campaigns and effective mortality reduction strategies.
